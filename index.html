    <h5>S'fundo Matu: A short bio</h5>
    <div class="short-bio">
        <p>If 21 year old S'fundo could only use one word to describe herself? It would definitely be daring. Hailing all the way
            from a small town of Empangeni, KwaZulu Natal, but spending most of her childhood interchanging between Gauteng and
            KwaZulu Natal, change is something that S'fundo is well-acquainted with. This is what has shaped her ability to adapted
            so easily in any environment that she may find herself in. She knows how to make do with what she has.
        </p>
        <P>S'fundo's friends would describe her as a talkative, empathetic introvert. Her knack for talking to people
            has made her a lot of friends along the way who find solace in her, but in her perfect world, she is in her room, either
            practicing a dance routine, or reading a book. In public, you'd find her quietly observing a room, but if you find her
            in her comfort zone, most likely with her friends, she would probably be the most talkative, and the most energetic
            person in the said room.
        </P>
        <p>S'fundo is known to dabble in a lot of different hobbies. She plays netball, she sings, she dances, and a hobby that she
            has recently started, is learning how to play the acoustic guitar. An aspiration of hers 
            is to one day become a director, making films that she hopes will shape young black girls' high esteem of themselves,
            and show them that they too, just like S'fundo learnt in her teen years, can be daring.
