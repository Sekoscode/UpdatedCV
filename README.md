# UpdatedCV

This project is titled "Updated CV" because it is my CV, but it has been updated with a README file.
It contains a thorough description of who I am, my competencies, and my skills and interests. It is important that potential employers have all this vital imformation.

## Table of Contents 
1. A short biography
2. Contact details
3. Headshot
4. Skills and Competencies
5. Other

## Installation 
To install this application, click on "index.html", and it will lead you to the CV.

## Method of Usage
For the most part, you will be reading. However, there is a search bar, for people who need to search specific keywords that they're looking for, and there is a comment section for anyone who has any comments, or wants to get in touch with me. These can be found by scrolling down, as they are found at the botton.
